# SaaS MRR Growth – 2024 Data Story (LLM-assisted)

**Contact:** 22f2000757@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
**LLM Assistance:** Code and narrative generated with ChatGPT (Codex/Jules).

## Executive Summary
Our 2024 quarterly MRR growth averages **7.4**, well below the **industry target of 15**. Growth dipped to a low in Q2 (3.26), recovered through Q3 (6.17), and rebounded in Q4 (13.62) but still underperforms the benchmark. The immediate priority is to **expand into new market segments** to unlock higher, more resilient growth while we also address retention and monetization fundamentals.

## Dataset
Quarterly MRR growth (2024):
- Q1: 6.53
- Q2: 3.26
- Q3: 6.17
- Q4: 13.62

**Average:** 7.4  
**Industry Target:** 15

> Source: internal quarterly MRR growth summary (illustrative for this analysis).

## Methods
1. Load quarterly MRR growth from `data/mrr_2024.csv`.
2. Compute averages, per-quarter gaps to the industry target, and rank quarters.
3. Visualize:
   - `charts/mrr_growth_trend_vs_target.png` – Quarterly trend vs a flat benchmark line (15).
   - `charts/gap_to_target_by_quarter.png` – Bar chart of (growth − 15) by quarter.
4. Summarize findings to inform strategy and near-term experiments.

To reproduce locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/analyze_mrr.py
```

## Key Findings
- **Underperformance vs. Benchmark:** Average growth of **7.4** trails the **15** target by **7.6 points**.
- **Volatility:** Large trough in **Q2 (3.26)**, gradual recovery by **Q4 (13.62)** shows responsiveness to initiatives but not yet parity with the industry benchmark.
- **Run-rate Gap:** Even Q4’s momentum needs ~**1.38** additional points to meet the target, suggesting both **demand expansion** and **conversion/retention** work are required.

## Business Implications
- **Planning & Targets:** Current trajectory risks **missing FY growth goals** if Q4 pace doesn’t persist and improve.
- **Capital Allocation:** Marketing and product investments should skew toward **new segment entry** and **activation/retention mechanics** that compound growth.
- **Risk Management:** Overreliance on existing segments increases exposure to demand saturation and competitive pricing pressure.

## Recommendations (Next 90–120 Days)
1. **Expand into New Market Segments** (Primary)
   - Validate 2–3 adjacent ICPs with targeted messaging, value props, and partner-led pilots.
   - Localize onboarding and support for high-potential geos/verticals.
2. **Acquire Efficiently**
   - Channel tests: partner marketplaces, integration directories, and community-driven loops.
   - Landing-page variants and demo flows tuned per segment.
3. **Monetize Smarter**
   - Package by segment: entry plan for price-sensitive segments; premium add-ons for enterprise.
   - Usage-based levers where value scales with adoption.
4. **Retain & Expand**
   - Cohort-based retention KPIs; lifecycle nudges to first-value and second-order features.
   - In-product nudges for upsell and cross-sell triggered by usage signals.
5. **Measurement Framework**
   - Define segment-aware funnel KPIs: visit→signup→activation→paid→retained.
   - Weekly checkpoint: segment growth, CAC trends, activation rate, net MRR add vs. target trajectory.
